# Sirex
Service layer architecture for Express.
</br>
</br>
Sirex is not a new "framework", but more of a why of using Express to build API's.</br>
Like the Express webiste says "Express is a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.</br>
Sirex is my opinion on how to use Express.

## CLI
### Install
<code>
npm i -g sirexjs
</code>

  Navigate to your project folder or ask Sirex to create a new project folder for you.
- **service - Create new service.<br/>**
  Use this option to create the folder structure and initial code to develop your new service.

  Creates a middleware template function in "src/middleware".
